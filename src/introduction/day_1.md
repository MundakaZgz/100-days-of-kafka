# Quickstart
Today we have created our own Kafka Cluster following the instructions in https://developer.confluent.io/quickstart/kafka-on-confluent-cloud. We have selected a Cluster running in Google cloud based in Belgium as we felt it was closer to Spain.

After that, we have created our first topic named *quickstart*. 
To test that topic we have sent some messages with a basic json content.
