# Preface
In this book I intend to keep track of all the learings from the challenge [#100daysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) about [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) following [Confluent's 100-day challenge](https://developer.confluent.io/100-days-of-code/).

In this journey I will also learn about [mdbook tool](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) and how to write books using markdown.

As it is easier to walk the walk if you are not alone I have my own group of crazy people doing the same challenge as me:
- [Cristina Rodriguez]()
- [Sagrario Carrillo]()
- [Ram√≥n Royo]()?
- [Juanlu Sanz](https://github.com/juanlu-sanz)?
