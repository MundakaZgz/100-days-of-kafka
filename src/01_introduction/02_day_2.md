# Day 2 - Events
Today we have learnt a very basic but a very important thing about events: "events are things that has happened".
With this simple concept in mind we have used the Confluent CLI (ccloud at the begining but we have also used the confluent cli, newest one ) to produce and consume events in an easy way from our console.

For the installation I have used the latest version under /usr/local/bin folder

```bash
## ccloud cli
curl -L --http1.1 https://cnfl.io/ccloud-cli | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin

# confluent cli
curl -L --http1.1 https://cnfl.io/cli | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin 
```

After login with each of the downloaded tools, I checked the clusters I had created.

After creating an API Key (which I am not going to share with you) and configuring it to be used with my cluster I was ready to start producing and consuming events from the CLI.

```bash
# command to prepare CLI to consume events from the topic poems
confluent kafka topic consume --from-beginning poems
```

```bash
# command to prepare CLI to produce events to the topic poems
confluent kafka topic produce --parse-key --delimiter : --value-format string poems
```

After this exercise I destroyed the cluster to avoid costs.
